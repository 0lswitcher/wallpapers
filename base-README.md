###### Yo, welcome to my desktop wallpapers/backgrounds repository. Below I've included some useful info regarding navigating this repo.

---

### "all" 
This is a dir for all of the images-*uncategorized* if that's your jam 

>  [!NOTE]
>  The catppuccin version of all the images are *not* included in this dir. For those, navigate to the "by-color" directory.

### "by-type"
This is a dir that contains all of the images categorized by type. (i.e. gif, space, abstract, etc.)

>  [!NOTE]
>  You may come across duplicates when exploring this dir, this is normal as I structured it for finding images as easily as possible,
>  not for avoiding seeing the same once twice.

### "by-color"
This is a dir that contains all of the images categorized by color. (i.e. purple, warm, dark, etc.)

>  [!NOTE]
>  I am extremely color-blind so apologies if this directory is lacking verbosity and not everything makes sense. I did my best to get assistance from my girlfriend who *isnt* colorblind for this, but I can't verify results. Thanks for understanding :)
